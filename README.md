# flutter_fancy_tree_view [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_fancy_tree_view.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_fancy_tree_view)

A [Flutter] collection of widgets and slivers that helps bringing your
hierarchical data to life.

This package builds a flat representation of tree structures and lazily renders
tree nodes to the screen on scroll using callbacks. This allows for tree nodes
to be provided in any data structure capable of representing hierarchical data.

<summary><h2>Installation</h2></summary>

Run this command:

```sh
flutter pub add flutter_fancy_tree_view
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an 
implicit `flutter pub get`):

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_fancy_tree_view: any
```

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_fancy_tree_view/flutter_fancy_tree_view.dart';
```

## Features

* Dynamic "Tree Node" Modeling
* Works with any Widget
* Indentation Guides
* Expand/Collapse Animations
* Sliver tree variants

For a hands on experience of the features, visit the [live demo app].
The source code for the demo app can be found in the [example directory].

## Getting Started

Head over to [example/example.md] for a well commented example of the
basic usage of this package.
Also, check out the [example/lib/src/examples] folder which has some
feature specific examples.

### Usage

1. Create a "Tree Node" model to store your data

```dart
class MyTreeNode {
  const MyTreeNode({
    required this.title,
    this.children = const <MyTreeNode>[],
  });

  final String title;
  final List<MyTreeNode> children;
}
```

2. Create/Fetch your hierarchical data

```dart
final List<MyTreeNode> roots = [
  const MyTreeNode(title: 'My static root node'),
  ...fetchOtherRootNodes(),
];
```

3. Instantiate a [TreeController](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_fancy_tree_view/latest/flutter_fancy_tree_view/TreeController-class.html).

```dart
final treeController = TreeController<MyTreeNode>(
  roots: roots,
  childrenProvider: (MyTreeNode node) => node.children,
);
```

4. Pass the controller to a [TreeView](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_fancy_tree_view/latest/flutter_fancy_tree_view/TreeView-class.html)
and provide a widget builder to map your data into widgets. Make sure to include
a way to toggle the tree nodes' expansion state and a [TreeIndentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_fancy_tree_view/latest/flutter_fancy_tree_view/TreeIndentation-class.html)
widget to properly indent them.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return AnimatedTreeView<MyTreeNode>(
    treeController: treeController,
    nodeBuilder: (BuildContext context, TreeEntry<MyTreeNode> entry) {
      return InkWell(
        onTap: () => treeController.toggleExpansion(entry.node),
        child: TreeIndentation(
          entry: entry,
          child: Text(entry.node.title),
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```
