# flutter_fancy_tree_view [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_fancy_tree_view.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_fancy_tree_view)

A [Flutter] collection of widgets and slivers that helps you bring life to your
hierarchical data.

This package builds a flat representation of tree structures and lazily renders
tree nodes to the screen on scroll using callbacks. This allows for tree nodes
to be provided in any data structure capable of representing hierarchical data.

## Installation

Run this command:

```sh
flutter pub add flutter_fancy_tree_view
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an 
implicit `flutter pub get`):

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_fancy_tree_view: any
```

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_fancy_tree_view/flutter_fancy_tree_view.dart';
```
