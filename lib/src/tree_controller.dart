/// Usage:

/// class Node {
///   Node(this.children);
///   List<Node> children;
/// }
///
/// final TreeController<Node> treeController = TreeController<Node>(

/// - getExpansionState(node) = [Set.contains]
/// - setExpansionState(node, true) = [Set.add]
/// - setExpansionState(node, false) = [Set.remove]
///
/// Those methods can be overridden to use other data structures if desired.

/// ```dart
/// class Node {
///   bool isExpanded = false;
/// }
///
/// class MyTreeController extends TreeController<Node> {
///   @override
///   bool getExpansionState(Node node) => node.isExpanded;
